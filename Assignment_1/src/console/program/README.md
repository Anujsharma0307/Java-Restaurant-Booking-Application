This is a simple ordering system used for a fast food Restaurant and caf√©. 
The primary data structure I have used here is ArrayList because it is easier to handle. 
It also auto applies discount if you order from multiple food places. 
It's my Assignment-1 for the Further Programming course in Software Engineering.
I was unable to implement The junit testing part due to lack of available time.
It is a console based food ordering program where the user can select from the 
type of restaurants or can search the name of the restaurant to select from its menu. 
User can order multiple items from multiple food places and can get the bill with 
discount on the checkout.
#Instructions to use
* The program runs from the main method of the main class
* Start entering acceptable values according to instructions provided 
* Exiting the code midway will automatically erase your cart, and you have to start ordering again.
* Press checkout option to finish ordering items and check the final bill.
